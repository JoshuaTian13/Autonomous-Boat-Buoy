# Buoy and Telemetry

This subsystem focused on buoy-based instrumentation and long-range data transmission.

## Key Features
- Built buoy platforms for both surface-level sensing and submersible capsule deployment.
- Integrated water quality sensors (pH, temperature, TDS) with microcontrollers for data logging.
- Implemented LoRa-based telemetry to send sensor readings with GPS and timestamps to a shore base station.
- Developed firmware to handle packet formatting and reliable serial communication.

## Outcome
The buoy prototypes demonstrated real-time water quality data collection, with telemetry transmitting data up to several hundred meters during field tests.
