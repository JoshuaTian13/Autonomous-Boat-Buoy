# Buoy Group Timeline

|Date|Description|
| --- | ---|
|7/15 - Started work on the project|We initially started out with two separate buoy groups, one of the groups worked on testing the sensors while the other group worked on buoy design.|
|7/18 - Started working on new responsibilities assigned by Jack.|Today we merged our groups together and created two plans for the two buoys: one of them would collect data from the surface (just the buoy) and the other one would collect data from below the surface (capsule).
