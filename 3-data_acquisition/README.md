# Data Acquisition

The Data Acquisition (DAQ) subsystem focused on ensuring accurate water quality measurements (pH, temperature, TDS) and forwarding the data reliably to the buoy and telemetry systems.

## Key Responsibilities
- Sensor calibration and accuracy testing.
- Hardware wiring and integration with Arduino and ESP32 boards.
- Serial communication between multiple microcontrollers.
- Forwarding capsule data to buoy microcontrollers for telemetry transmission.

## Outcome
DAQ provided accurate, filtered readings from multiple sensors, enabling real-time environmental monitoring. Finalized firmware supported serial communication between Arduino Mega and ESP32 modules.
