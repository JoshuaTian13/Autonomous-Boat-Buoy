# Data Acquisition – Detailed Notes

## Project Purpose
Support the autonomous boat and buoy system by assuring accurate data readings and providing microcontroller code to transmit capsule sensor data.

## Tasks
- Hardware: sensor calibration, wiring, programming.
- Software: serial communication (ESP32 ↔ Arduino).

## Materials
- Microcontrollers: Arduino UNO, MEGA, NANO; ESP32
- Sensors: pH, TDS, temperature
- Calibration solutions for pH, TDS, and temperature
- Prototyping supplies: jumper wires, protoboard, breadboard, solder
- Hall effect sensor for capsule retrieval
- Software: Arduino IDE, GitHub, Onshape, Google Photos, Discord
