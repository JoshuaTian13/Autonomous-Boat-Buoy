# Autonomous Boat

This component focused on converting a Traxxas high-speed RC Boat into an autonomous surface vehicle capable of following GPS waypoints.

## Key Contributions
- Integrated a flight controller (Pixhawk) with GPS and RC override.  
- Used **Mission Planner** and **GroundControl** software for autonomous navigation.  
- Designed and 3D-printed custom enclosures to protect electronics from water exposure.  
- Modified the steering system and powertrain for improved agility and responsiveness.  

## Challenges
- Hardware failures with 3D-printed propellers and enclosures.  
- Tuning GPS and autopilot firmware for reliable path-following.  
- Synchronizing manual override with autonomous operation.  

## Results
- Successfully demonstrated autonomous navigation across waypoints at Miramar Lake.  
- Boat was able to follow GPS paths while allowing data collection at predetermined stops.
